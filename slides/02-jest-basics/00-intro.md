Jest is JavaScript unit testing framework built by Facebook.

In this section we are going to explore the conventions used by Facebook.

<div class="callout secondary">

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Jest 15**

Starting [version 15][jest-15], Jest simplified a lot of setup process and was made less opinionated
about automocking to address long standing pain of using it in open source. At Facebook we haven't
transitioned to the new layout.
